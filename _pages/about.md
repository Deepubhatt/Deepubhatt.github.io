I’m **Deepak Bhatt**, hailing from the beautiful state of *Uttarakhand*, and currently living in **Greater Noida**.

I hold an **M.Sc. in Mathematics** from *Central University of Karnataka* and a **B.Sc. (Hons) in Mathematics** from *Dyal Singh College, Delhi University*.

My interest in mathematics began during my **12**<sup>**th**</sup> at *Army Public School, Meerut*, where I studied in the science stream and developed a strong passion for **Mathematics**.

After completing my post-graduation, I explored several fields before diving into **Data Science and Analytics**. This transition led me to acquire a strong skill set, which includes:

- **Programming & Data Analysis**: Python, SQL, Excel
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Hands-on experience in various models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

<span style = "font-family: Georgia;"> Why Data Science? </span>
=======

Data Science excites me because it combines my passion for *solving real-world problems* with my strong mathematical background. The logical thinking and problem-solving skills I’ve developed through mathematics allow me to tackle complex analytical challenges effectively.

I enjoy working with large datasets, building predictive models, and continuously learning new tools and techniques to improve my skills in this ever-evolving, **data-driven world**.

The growth of **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI)** also fascinates me, and I believe that combining these skills with my foundation in mathematics and analytics will allow me to have a meaningful impact in the industry.
