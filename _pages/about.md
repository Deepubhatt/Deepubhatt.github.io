<span style = "font-family: Cambria;">
I’m **Deepak Bhatt**, hailing from the beautiful state of *Uttarakhand*, and currently living in *Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh*. </span>

<span style = "font-family: Cambria;">
I hold an **M.Sc. in Mathematics** from *Central University of Karnataka* and a **B.Sc. (Hons) in Mathematics** from *Dyal Singh College, Delhi University*. </span>

<span style = "font-family: Cambria;">
My interest in mathematics began during my 12<sup>th</sup> at *Army Public School, Meerut Cantt*, where I studied in the science stream and developed a strong passion for *Mathematics*. </span>

<span style = "font-family: Cambria;">
After completing my post-graduation, I explored several fields before diving into **Data Science and Analytics**. This transition led me to acquire a strong skill set, which includes: </span>

- <span style = "font-family: Cambria;"> **Programming & Data Analysis**: Python, SQL, Excel </span>
- <span style = "font-family: Cambria;"> **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn </span>
- <span style = "font-family: Cambria;"> **Machine Learning & AI**: Hands-on experience in various models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) </span>

## <span style = "font-family: Georgia;"> Why Data Science? </span>

<span style = "font-family: Cambria;">
Data Science excites me because it combines my passion for *solving real-world problems* with my strong mathematical background. The logical thinking and problem-solving skills I’ve developed through mathematics allow me to tackle complex analytical challenges effectively. </span>

<span style = "font-family: Cambria;">
I enjoy working with large datasets, building predictive models, and continuously learning new tools and techniques to improve my skills in this *ever-evolving data-driven world*. </span>

<span style = "font-family: Cambria;">
The growth of **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI)** also fascinates me, and I believe that combining these skills with my foundation in mathematics and analytics will allow me to have a meaningful impact in the industry. </span>
