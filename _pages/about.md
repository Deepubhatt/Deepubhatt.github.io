Iâ€™m **Deepak Bhatt**, hailing from the beautiful state of Uttarakhand, and I am currently living in Greater Noida. I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics from _Central University of Karnataka (2022)_ and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics with Honors from _Dyal Singh College, Delhi University_. My interest in mathematics began during my 12th at _Army Public School, Meerut_, where I studied in the science stream and developed a strong passion for **Mathematics**.

After completing my post-graduation, I explored several fields before diving into **Data Science and Analytics**. This transition led me to acquire a strong skill set, which includes:

- **Programming & Data Analysis**: Python, SQL, Excel
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Hands-on experience in various models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

I am passionate about solving real-world problems using data and love to leverage my mathematical background to tackle complex analytical challenges. Whether it's analyzing large datasets or building predictive models, I am always excited about learning new techniques and improving my skills.

<span style="color:crimson;"> Why Data Science? </span>
========

</span>

Data Science appeals to me for a number of reasons. My background in mathematics has ingrained in me the ability to think logically and solve complex problems systematically, which aligns well with the problem-solving nature of Data Science. As the world becomes more data-driven, mastering tools and techniques in this field is not only exciting but essential for contributing to real-world solutions.

The growth of **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI)** also fascinates me, and I believe that combining these skills with my foundation in mathematics and analytics will allow me to have a meaningful impact in the industry.
