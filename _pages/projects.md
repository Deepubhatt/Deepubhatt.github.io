<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking data to uncover patterns influencing cancellation rates. The primary objective was to identify actionable insights that could help optimize revenue by reducing these cancellation rates. </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> Tools Used: </span>

- <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Jupyter Notebook:** For Python programming and analysis </span>
- <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Python Libraries:** </span>
  - <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Pandas:** Data exploration and manipulation </span>
  - <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Seaborn & Matplotlib:** Data visualization </span>
- <span style="font-family: Cambria;"> **Google Slides:** For generating the final report </span>

<span style="font-family: Cambria;"> By using these tools, I identified *key factors* contributing to cancellations, such as booking lead time, pricing, and weather conditions. Based on these insights, I proposed *targeted strategies* aimed at optimizing bookings and enhancing revenue management, including dynamic pricing, effective lead time management, and improved customer engagement to minimize cancellations and boost overall revenue. </span>
