I conducted an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data to uncover patterns behind cancellation rates. By leveraging Python for data exploration and visualization, I identified key factors contributing to cancellations, including booking lead time, customer demographics, and special requests. Based on these insights, I proposed actionable strategies to optimize bookings and improve revenue management. This project also includes predictive models to forecast cancellation likelihood, aiding hotels in making data-driven decisions.
